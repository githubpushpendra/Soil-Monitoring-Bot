   This module named "adc_control".

   De0-nano FPGA board has an analog to digital converter and our bot needs to take analog input to detect white and black surface.
So I used this ADC ( analog to digital converter ). To use it I have write verilog design which uses ADC and stores its digital 
output. Now I have digital output to know whether it is black or white surface.

   I have used ADC's three channels ( channel 5,channel 6 and channel 7 ) out of seven because I am getting three anlog inputs from three defferent channels of Line Follower Sensor.
By the digital converted value I can easly know whether any sensor is on the black or white surface.



THIS CODE IS PART OF TASK_2A.
