   This module named "SM1511_CD".

   This module is designed to detect color. In this project we are using "tcs3200" color sensor to detect red, green and
blue color at a time. This color sensor gives an output square wave of perticular frequency for a perticular color . This
sensor has three color filters -- red , green and blue filter and one conditoin is when no filter is on.

   I am making every filter on for some nano-seconds one by one and counting frequency of output wave for every filter.
The module light up red led, green and blue led for red, green and blue color detection respecrtively.




THIS CODE IS PART OF TASK_4, TASK_5 AND TASK_6.
