   UART = Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmeter

   This Module is written to send a message through Zigbee module. This folder contains two verilog files.
one is "uart_SM11" , it will send "SM11" message once after progran run. The message can be seen through Hterm
software. And second file "uart_eYRC-Completed" , this module will send message "eYRC-Completed" with 1 second 
delay. This can be seen in video given in the folder.

   Both the designs are very defferent . Any task if the two tasks can be done by any design of the two designs.

   Zigbee uses "Serial Data Transmission & Reception" . Receiver Zigbee start receiving data after detecting start 
bit. And stop receiving data after detecting stop bit.

   START BIT ----- Start bit is "low signal with fixed duration". In our project this duration is 2*434 clock cylcles.
 
   STOP BIT ----- Stop bit is "high signal with fixed duration". duration is same 2*434 clock cycles.

   Between start bit and stop bit whatever the bits are detected is stored as data bits. So we need to send our
message between start bit ans stop bit.


THIS CODE IS PART OF TASK_2B.
